# Virasoro Project

[link to docs and blueprint](https://kkytola.github.io/VirasoroProject)

This project is a Lean-formalization of topics related to the Virasoro algebra. The current scope is mainly:
 * the construction of the Virasoro algebra as the (unique) 1-dimensional central extension of the Witt algebra. (`«VirasoroProject».VirasoroAlgebra`)

To enable the construction, the project contains API development for
 * Lie algebra cohomology in degree two (`«VirasoroProject».LieCohomologySmallDegree`)
 * central extensions constructed from 2-cocycles (`«VirasoroProject».CentralExtension`)
 * the "characteristic predicate" of central extensions as short exact sequences (`«VirasoroProject».IsCentralExtension`)

and the definition of
 * the Witt algebra (`«VirasoroProject».WittAlgebra`)
 * and its 2-cocycle which defines the Virasoro algebra as its central extension (`«VirasoroProject».VirasoroCocycle`)

and finally
 * the proof (*by calculation!*) that the 2-cohomology of the Witt algebra is one-dimensional and is generated by the (class of the) Virasoro cocycle. (`«VirasoroProject».WittAlgebraCohomology`)

As a rather trivial second application of the API of central extensions, the project defines also
 * the Heisenberg (Lie) algebra as the 1-dimensional central extension of a countably infinite-dimensional abelian Lie algebra associated with an explicit nonzero 2-cocycle. (`«VirasoroProject».HeisenbergAlgebra`)

The main purpose of this mathematically less interesting second case is to enable the Sugawara construction, by which one can equip positive energy representations of the Heisenberg algebra with a representation of the Virasoro algebra also. But so far I have not had time to teach that to Lean.
